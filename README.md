This is the code for "How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning #1' by Siraj Raval on YouTube

##Overview 
The goal is to predict an animal's body weight given it's brain weight. The model we'll be using is called Linear Regression. The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals. We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.
